## Three class classification of lung sound signals using the STFT features
Here 2D convolutional neural networks(CNN) are implemented along with the regularisation techniques on the features that are extracted from the raw data of audio(.wav) files using the STFT(Short Term Fouries Transform) lead method.

###Dataset
The dataset is multiclassified, with three distinct categories: Healthy(68), COPD(94), and Pneumonia(74). [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ocAnflkx6kCnMr7RdpKslfWfOEHP3vD)
